# _Learning opportunity:_
## _Undoubtedly, this project has been a remarkable avenue for expanding my programming knowledge and skill set, providing an enriching learning experience that allowed me to delve into advanced programming techniques and gain a deeper understanding of web development. Regrettably, upon conducting a comprehensive review, it is clear that the site's level of technical complexity may not align with its intended purpose. This realisation has prompted me to contemplate a new direction for the project, one that embraces a more straightforward and user-friendly approach. Furthermore, I intend to reduce the site's reliance on JavaScript for functionality, ensuring that users with JavaScript-disabled browsers can access the content seamlessly._
